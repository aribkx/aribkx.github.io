<!--<p style ="color : white">Arsenal Football Club was founded in 1886 as a munition workers' team from Woolwich, then in Kent, now southeast London. They turned professional in 1891 and joined The Football League two years later.
    They were promoted to the First Division in 1904 but financial problems meant they were liquidated and reformed.</p>-->
<p style ="color : white"><strong>Who we are</strong><br>
    Arsenal Football Club was born when a group of workers at Dial Square armaments factory
    in Woolwich, notably exiled Scotsman David Danskin and Jack Humble, decided to form a football team to break the monotony of factory life.</p>
<blockquote><p style ="color : white">"Arsenal Football Club exists to make our fans proud wherever they are in the world and however they choose to follow us"</p>
</blockquote>
<p style ="color : white">Since that Dial Square team played its first match against Eastern Wanderers in 1886, Arsenal has gone on to become one of Londonâ€™s most successful football clubs and one of the most famous names in modern football with millions of passionate followers worldwide.
</p>
<p style ="color : white">Steeped in history and tradition, Arsenal Football Club has thrived on a pioneering and innovative spirit that has existed throughout its 125 years in existence. While society and football may have changed during this time, Arsenal has always served to create a sense of community for people here in Islington, across the UK and now around the world.
