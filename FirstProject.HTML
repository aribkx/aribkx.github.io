<p> ARIB Khan also commonly known as the greatest coder alive was born on January 24th 2004 at el camino hospital in Santa Clara. He began his coding at the young age of 16. He excelled much quicker than most students in the course so he was given the take of curing cancer and covid 19 using his coding expertise and within three days Mr. Khan learned that if he used the heartbeat sensors on most people apple watches and rerouted the power to cause an electric pulse the cancer and covid cells would slowly begin to weak and the anti bodies in our blood would be able to fight of the disease in turn curing humanity.
    Thank you Mr. Khan.
